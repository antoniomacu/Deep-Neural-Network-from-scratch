# Deep Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a deep neural network from scratch in Python using only NumPy, inspired by the coursework and assignments from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

## About

The pourpose of the project was to challenge myself on implementing a neural network, applying it to an interesting dataset different from the one used in the course and mantain the workflow using **git**.

- In `nn_functions.py` you cand find all the functions that implement forward and backward propagation for a binary classification task using **ReLU** and **Sigmoid** as activations (this was clearly inspired by the material of the course).
- The notebook (.ipynb) includes a small but fun application and test of the NN, using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** from [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic) that includes data from 569 patients with tumors that were either bening or malignant.
