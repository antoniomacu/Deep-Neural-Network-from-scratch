# Deep Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a deep neural network from scratch in Python using only NumPy, inspired by the coursework and assignments from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

## About

The notebook and accompanying scripts demonstrate:
- The full workflow for building, training, and evaluating a deep neural network
- Implementation of forward and backward propagation, parameter updates, and cost calculation manually (without high-level libraries)
- Application to the breast cancer classification dataset
- Code structure and workflow inspired by the DeepLearning.AI course, with my own experimentation and exploration
